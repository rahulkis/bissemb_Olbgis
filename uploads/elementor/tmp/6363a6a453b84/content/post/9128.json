For example, Geo marketing may assist you in ensuring that you are not promoting winter coats in Florida! A case in point to understand which product must be promoted where.

As a result, if you want to target your clients based on their geolocation, you can use any or all of the below Geo-marketing strategies:<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Geotargeting<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Geotargeting refers to the process of delivering different content to users based on their geolocation. This contains parameters such as country, region\/state, city, metro code\/zip code, company, IP address, ISP, and others. For example, you may have observed that an online retail business, even though it is foreign, generally displays your local currency. This is the best example of geotargeting at work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Geofencing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This allows marketers to use the precise GPS position of a consumer's mobile device rather than its IP address. The advantage of geofencing is that the GPS position automatically updates whenever the consumer moves. As a result, it enables more relevant and timely messaging. For example, when people walk by a coffee shop, push alerts for special discounts can be triggered.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Geoconquesting<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Geo conquesting utilizes the location data to locate a brand's competitors in order to promote a competing or competitive service to their customers. Geo conquesting is the practice of geofencing visitors to competition locations. For example, if the local coffee shop wants to compete in the face of giants like Starbucks, it might establish a geofence around such businesses and then target their customers with attractive promotions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Beacons<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Beacons try to target your customers with greater precision than geofencing. A beacon is a small device that collects Bluetooth location data from any nearby mobile device. Because beacons are Bluetooth-based, they may be utilized in regions where cell service is poor, such as the inside of a dept store.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:list --><\/p>"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"},{"id":"16f1a20","settings":[],"elements":[{"id":"2538cfac","settings":{"_column_size":100,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[{"id":"5378aa6f","settings":{"image":{"url":"http:\/\/olbgis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/jason-leung-vaBBmzNosOY-unsplash.jpg","id":9157,"alt":"","source":"library"},"image_size":"medium_large"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"image","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"},{"id":"f110808","settings":[],"elements":[{"id":"742d78a0","settings":{"_column_size":100,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[{"id":"69f5bbdc","settings":{"editor":"<p><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Real-time example of Geo marketing<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"color: var(--edumall-color-text); letter-spacing: 0em;\">The Luxury department store, Barneys, New York, digitised its novel flagship in Manhattan. They equipped all their employees with iPads to offer their consumers using the Barney\u2019s app a better personalised shopping experience. Clients engaging with the app primarily receive a prompt to access their location. This location data is then use to determine client\u2019s proximities from one of the Barneys retail locations. Those who gave access to the app, while shopping, receive targeted recommendations based on their shopping behaviours. Further, Barneys app promotes other local attractions around its store. Thus, their customer-centric Geo-Marketing tactic makes life easier for their prospects rather than merely being an intrusion of the collection of data to escalate sales.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"color: var(--edumall-color-text); letter-spacing: 0em;\">Geo-Marketing is an amazing tool for showing data with a geographic context; it may provide access to an entirely new world of Marketing strategies based on geographic data.
