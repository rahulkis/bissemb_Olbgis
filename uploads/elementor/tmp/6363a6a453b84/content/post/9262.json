It is an important part of crime analysis and policing strategy. GIS is an interface for integrating and accessing enormous volumes of location-based information that employs geography and computer-generated maps. GIS enables police officers to better prepare for emergency response, establish mitigation priorities, analyse previous occurrences, and forecast future events. It may also be used to deliver important information to emergency responders as they are sent or enroute to an incident, assisting in tactical planning and reaction. GIS assists law enforcement in locating probable crime scenes by assessing apparently unrelated criteria and displays them together in a graphical, layered, spatial interface or map.<\/p><blockquote><h6><span style=\"color: #696969; font-size: 14px;\">Some of the applications of GIS in crime include the following:<br \/>1.Crime identification<br \/>2.Crime mapping<br \/>3.Crime investigation<br \/>4 Crime prediction<br \/>5.

The crime data set utilised in this study is from Data.gov, Open Baltimore data. The data sets include various properties, including spatial and temporal homicide, shooting, rape, and other crime statistics from 2012 to 2018. The crime statistics are credited to the Baltimore Police Department's computerised ward map. The police station locations are updated using a field survey of the GPS. The Geographic Information System (GIS) of Geographic dataset visualises and allows law enforcement to discover spatial crime patterns map easily and flexible and diverse analyses to effectively identify the crime hotspot location. Analysis of crime hotspots using GIS is an effective technique to recognise crime patterns and anticipate hotspots based on geographical correlation, analysis of spatial data, and future detection of crime patterns. The G* statistic has been done using hotspot analysis the Getis-Ord Gi* to identify the outcome of the spatial statistics pattern employing spatial correlation. The crime analysis to predict hotspot approach use geographic variation and density crimes to clarify the sites of statistically significant crime forecast hotspots and cold spots, and the GIS interpolation method is employed for more efficient representation. To better visualise the results of the Hotpot analysis, the weighted interpolation method Inverse Distance was applied. The distance is calculated using the Euclidian Distance. Concentrating on the variance in order to have the best distance between the crime to be evaluated on the map's fishnets grid visualisations. Using the variance to get the ideal distance between the spots and the Euclidian distance to determine the distance between all the crimes on the map. GIS is also used to construct geographical profiling of criminals, a form of investigation that allows authorities to discover locations of associated crimes to assist determine where an offender may living, particularly in repeated instances.<\/p><p><strong>Abbreviation:<\/strong><\/p><p><strong><em>GIS:<\/em><\/strong> <em>A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system that generates, maintains, analyses, and maps various types of data.
