Potential adverse impacts include sea-level rise; increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, floods, droughts, and tropical storms; changes in the amount, timing, and distribution of rain, snow, and runoff; and disturbance of coastal marine and other ecosystems.<\/p><p>Rising atmospheric CO2 is also increasing the absorption of CO2 by seawater, causing the ocean to become more acidic (ocean acidification) with potentially disruptive effects on marine plankton and coral reefs.<\/p><p>Carbon sequestration is defined as the process by which CO2 is either removed from the atmosphere or diverted from emission sources and stored in the ocean, terrestrial environments ( vegetation, soil, and sediments), and geologic formations.
