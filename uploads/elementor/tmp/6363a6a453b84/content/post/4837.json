By processing geospatial data from satellite imaging, aerial photography and remote sensors, users gain a detailed perspective on land and infrastructure. As urban populations grow and spread the importance of GIS lies in its ability to pull together the vast amounts of information necessary to balance competing priorities and solve complicated problems, such as optimizing new building placement or determining the feasibility of a waste disposal site.<\/span><\/h6><\/blockquote>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><b>Planning steps:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} --><\/p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>&nbsp;Prepare residential plans and distribute services according to planning standards in an ideal way<\/li>\n<li>Convert 2d maps to 3d<\/li>\n<li>Spatial Analysis of Services<\/li>\n<li>View the trends of urban growth and re-planning slums Infrastructure management such as water and electricity networks<\/li>\n<li>Land administration in the city through a special database<\/li>\n<li>Identify trends for future expansion of the city<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><!-- \/wp:list --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><b>How we can use GIS in urban planning:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} --><\/p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Begin with the field vision of the site to identify the spatial phenomena in the site of rivers, plains and valleys to choose the most suitable installations in general and determine the suitability of the height of buildings and dangerous and safe areas.<\/li>\n<li>Draw croquettes for the area and transfer the reality to a graphical form.<\/li>\n<li>Land uses to make a geographical database and transfer graphics from paper to computer through digital maps (smart) and begin to enter a description for each spatial statement in the geographical database<\/li>\n<li>Modeling the criteria for selecting each land use by analyzing the data spatially according to field lifting data and data on the purpose of the construction, is it to accommodate population capacity and low-cost buildings?
