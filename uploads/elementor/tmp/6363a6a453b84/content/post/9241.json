Recent studies have found that the cause of this phenomena is the conversion of natural surfaces with low thermal inertia, such as greenery, to man-made structures with high thermal inertia, such as roadways and concrete buildings. This phenomenon is known as \"Urban Heat Island,\" and remote sensing and GIS have been found to be important techniques for studying it.\n\nUrban Heat Island is a result of\u00a0\u00a0<span style=\"color: var(--edumall-color-text); letter-spacing: 0em;\">a) urbanisation and (b) anthropogenic growth. The first is to adjust the land cover as urbanisation erases the natural ground by substituting non-porous built-up surfaces for the natural surface content. The second is due to shipping and manufacturing activities resulting in a shift in the equilibrium of ambient surface energy by trap, incoming solar radiation during the day and reradiation at night. UHI is recognised as an issue that arises as a consequence of urban areas' uncontrolled development.<\/span>\n<blockquote>\n<h6><span style=\"color: #696969; font-size: 14px;\">UHI can usually be represented by air temperature and it is simple to obtain LST from remotely sensed images. The relationship between Land surface temperature (LST) and Land use and Land cover (LULC) can be demonstrated by remotely sensed data. In order to perform the UHI analysis, Landsat data was commonly used. The association between LULC and LST greatly helps to assess the effects of the transition in LULC on the LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a parameter that has a direct impact on the study of UHI. Based on the above relationship between LST and NDVI, due to the difference in NDVI between various LULC forms, the LULC shift would indirectly influence the LST..<\/span><\/h6>\n<\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- \/wp:list -->"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"},{"id":"6f5c40f6","settings":[],"elements":[{"id":"360af33c","settings":{"_column_size":100,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"},{"id":"5baa30cf","settings":[],"elements":[{"id":"3f9cab02","settings":{"_column_size":100,"_inline_size":null},"elements":[{"id":"7f5cec09","settings":{"editor":"<p><strong>Case Study<\/strong><\/p><p>A Research is being conducted on a region of the Chennai city in India to show the spatial and temporal pattern and changes of urban heat island (UHI).

Four land use and land cover (LULC) types (Vegetation, Barren land, built-up area and water) were classified from the Landsat images by supervised classification techniques using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm.
