Learn more and get a free Setmore account at [Setmore.com](http://setmore.com).

### Add Setmore to your site

After entering your unique Setmore URL, to display the scheduler on your site:

* use a **widget** to place a "Book Appointments" button in a sidebar area
* use the **shortcode** to embed the Setmore scheduler directly in a page, or add a link or a button that opens the scheduler in a popup window
* create a **menu link** that opens the scheduler in a popup window

The widget and shortcode also work with individual staff booking pages. Full instructions are included.

This plugin can *leave no trace!* If you delete the plugin, all settings will be removed from the database. However, simply deactivating it will leave your settings in place, as expected.

### Privacy and GDPR

This plugin embeds the content of the Setmore online app in an iFrame. It stores the URL for your public setmore.com booking page, the same URL you can enter into any browser to access your Setmore scheduler.

It does not store your setmore.com login credentials, account information or any other private data.

It does not store any visitor data.

By using the embedded Setmore scheduler, you will be agreeing to Setmore's [Terms of Use](https://www.setmore.com/#terms-of-use).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Setmore account? =

Visit [Setmore.com](http://setmore.com) to get your free account. A [premium plan](http://www.setmore.com/premium) with more features is also available.

= How do I change the "Book Appointment" button? =

In the widget, you can select the default image button, a trendy flat button, or a plain link.

To create a custom button, select the plain link option, then add style rules for `a.setmore` in your theme's stylesheet or custom CSS function, or try [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/).

For example, here's a square blue button with white text:

`a.setmore {
	background: #4372AA;
	color: #eee;
	display: inline-block;
	margin: 10px 0;
	padding: 10px 20px;
	text-decoration: none;
	text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}

a.setmore:hover {
	background: #769CC9;
	color: #fff;
	text-decoration: none;
}`

= Can I use different languages? =

Yes. Setmore.com supports 31 languages. You can select the default language for your site and also select a specific language for each shortcode or widget.

= Leave no trace? What's that about? =

Some plugins and themes don't fully uninstall everything they installed - things like settings, database tables, subdirectories. That bugs me. Sometimes, it bugs your WordPress too.

So this plugin has an option to completely remove itself upon deletion. Simply deactivating the plugin will leave the settings intact.
